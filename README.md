# Autoencoder for MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates a basic autoencoder implemented with Keras for dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

## About the Project

This project implements a simple autoencoder neural network to learn a compressed representation of the MNIST handwritten digit images. The autoencoder consists of an encoder that maps the input images to a lower-dimensional latent space (bottleneck) and a decoder that reconstructs the images from this latent space. The goal is to train the network to minimize the reconstruction error, forcing the bottleneck layer to capture the most important features of the input data.

This can be useful for tasks like:

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features needed to represent the data.
- **Noise Reduction:** Learning to ignore noise in the input data during reconstruction.
- **Feature Extraction:** The encoded representation in the bottleneck can serve as a set of learned features for other tasks.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python and the following libraries:

*   tensorflow
*   keras
*   numpy
*   pandas
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd your_project_name
    ```
3.  Install the required libraries
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## Usage

You can run the code directly in a Google Colab or in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook `autoencoder_mnist.ipynb` contains the complete code and visualizations.

1.  Open the notebook in a Google Colab (like Jupyter Notebook, or JupyterLab).
2.  Run the cells sequentially to load the data, build the model, train it, and visualize the results.

## Model Architecture

The autoencoder has the following architecture:

-   **Encoder:**
    -   Input Layer: 784 dimensions (28x28 flattened image)
    -   Hidden Layer 1: 256 dimensions, ReLU activation
    -   Bottleneck Layer: 100 dimensions, ReLU activation (the compressed representation)
-   **Decoder:**
    -   Hidden Layer 2: 256 dimensions, ReLU activation
    -   Output Layer: 784 dimensions, Sigmoid activation (reconstructed image)

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

## Results

After training, the notebook visualizes:

-   Original MNIST images
-   Encoded representations (visualized as 10x10 grids)
-   Decoded (reconstructed) images

This allows for a visual comparison of the original and reconstructed images to assess the autoencoder's performance.
