About this project
This project implements a basic autoencoder using the Keras library to demonstrate dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction on the MNIST dataset.

What it is about:

The core idea is to train a neural network to encode the input data into a lower-dimensional representation (the bottleneck layer) and then decode it back to the original dimension. By minimizing the reconstruction loss, the autoencoder learns to capture the essential features of the data in the encoded representation.

Specifically, this notebook:

Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits).
Defines an autoencoder model with an encoder, bottleneck, and decoder.
Trains the autoencoder on the MNIST training data.
Visualizes the original, encoded (lower-dimensional), and decoded (reconstructed) images to show the autoencoder's performance.
This project provides a hands-on example of how autoencoders can be used for tasks like image compression and feature extraction.
